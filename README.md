This project is a software implementation of a CAN bus. An STM32F072 microcontroller is used. An external clock (HSE) must be used. The project uses an 8 MHz crystal. Additionally, the -O1 optimization must be enabled.

WARNING! This is only a sample CAN bus "bit banding" project. This project should not be used in real-world applications!
