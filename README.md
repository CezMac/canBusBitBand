This project is a software implementation of a CAN bus using an STM32F072 microcontroller. An external high-speed clock (HSE) running at 8 MHz is required. Additionally, compiler optimization level -O1 must be enabled.

WARNING: This is only a sample CAN bus project demonstrating bit-banding techniques. It is not intended for use in real-world applications!
